<h2>So, again, what is this?</h2>
<br>
<h3>A simple tool to keep track of your Medications.</h3>
<br>

<p>Like I stated earlier on the homepage, I'm considering this the MVP for a much larger project I'm working on. It just so happens that it also serves as an app that can be helpful to people.</p>

<br>
<p> I was thinking about some of the factors and concerns in my life, and what things might be useful to me. Because of my desire for organization and effeciency (the state of this app notwithstanding), I decided that the idea for this project would be a sort of reminder/assistant/organizer dealie. <br>
<br>   
I have yet to nail down the completed idea. But sometimes, you just have to get some code on the board, and so here's what I threw up: a small app to make and maintain a list. I'll likely refine with some added bells and whistles like user accounts, so that individuals in the same family who are using the app can maybe, set reminders or send messages to / for each other(?) while still having their own account access and control. <br> 
<br>
Also, a nice little calendar that will show the days that meds have been taken effectively, and change color(green/red) depending on user activation. Right now, the skeleton of that feature exists as the Week bar on the list page. I'm still deciding how I want it to look, like many other elements. Maybe a google calender knockoff?? We'll see...

</p> <br>  <p>These elements will segue into a larger project, which is intended to be a sort of personal assistant type thing. Still working out the kinks, really. </p>
